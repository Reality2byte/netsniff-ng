Notes:

Note that we have taken over the maintenance and further development of Herbert
Haas' mausezahn [ˈmauzəˌtsa:n] utility after he passed away in 2011. There were
no Git commit statistics available from the import of his project. The project
is currently in a staging area, but will be fully integrated soon. (*)

Want to join the core team? Submit enough great patches over a long time,
implement what's on the TODO file and show an ongoing, active interest in
supporting netsniff-ng. What's in it for you? If you ever come to Switzerland,
you get a free beer on Daniel and you can meet some great people involved in
this project. ;)
